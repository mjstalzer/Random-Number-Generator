# Random-Number-Generator
    * Homework 3

* This project made me apply some javascript knowledge to create a random password generator.

    * I created multiple variables, created confirms and prompts, and utilized the for loop.
        * I also had to make use of if/else statements and functions.

    * After I had the password generator complete, I had to make it more user friendly.
        * I accomplished this by using javascript tools such as querySelector and addEventListener.
        
    * This project showed me how to make my code less dry by implementing a function to accomplish one task multiple times.
